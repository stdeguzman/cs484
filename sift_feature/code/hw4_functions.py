    #   (a) suppress boundary interest points (where a feature wouldn't fit entirely in the image, anyway), or
    #   (b) scale the image filters being used.
    # Or you can ignore it.

    # 'x' and 'y' are nx1 vectors of x and y coordinates of interest points.

    # Implement the Harris corner detector (See Szeliski 4.1.1) to start with.

    # If you're finding spurious interest point detections near the boundaries,
    # it is safe to simply suppress the gradients / corners near the edges of
    # the image.

    #   (i.e., every cell of your local SIFT-like feature will have an integer width and height).
    # If you want to detect and describe features at multiple scales or
    # particular orientations, then you can add input arguments.

    # 'features' is the array of computed features. It should have the
    #   following size: [length(x) x feature dimensionality] (e.g. 128 for
    #   standard SIFT)
